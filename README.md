**XJConverter** is a lightweight command-line tool that converts **XML files to JSON files** quickly and efficiently.

## ðŸ›  Features

* Convert any well-formed XML file to JSON.
* Simple command-line usage â€” no GUI required.
* Specify output file path for JSON.
* Fast and reliable for small to medium-sized XML files.
* Preserves nested XML structures and attributes.

---

## ðŸ’» Usage

Open a command prompt and run:

```bash
XJConverter.exe <InputXMLFile.xml> <OutputJSONFile.json>
```

### Example

```bash
XJConverter.exe sample.xml output.json
```

* `sample.xml` â†’ The XML file you want to convert.
* `output.json` â†’ The path and name of the resulting JSON file.

### Example Workflow with Full Paths

```bash
XJConverter.exe C:\Users\Name\Documents\data.xml C:\Users\Name\Documents\data.json
```

This converts `data.xml` to `data.json` in the same folder.
